With You Every Step of the Way The Tobey/Slater/Blair/Crawford series retains the hallmark characteristics that have always made the text so easy to learn and teach from, including a â€œbuilding blockâ€ organization. Each program builds essential skills and conceptual understanding by breaking the mathematics down into manageable pieces. The new editions address the latest trends and dynamics related to developmental mathematics course structures, including helping students gain a stronger conceptual understanding, while contextualizing the math. Instructors will find the inclusion of new conceptually oriented Guided Learning Videos with the accompanying Video Workbook with the Math Coach (in MyMathLab), plus a new emphasis on Career Explorations throughout the text and MyMathLab course to help students explore potential career paths. The Tobey series is flexible, and well-suited for a variety of classroom formats, including lecture-based, computer-lab based (modular and/or self-paced), hybrid, and online. Also available with MyMathLab MyMathLabÂ® is an online homework, tutorial, and assessment program designed to work with this text to engage students and improve results. Within its structured environment, students practice what they learn, test their understanding, and pursue a personalized study plan that helps them absorb course material and understand difficult concepts. For this edition, the MyMathLab course includes new Guided Learning Videos and an updated and expanded Video Workbook with the Math Coach. Note: You are purchasing a standalone product; MyLabâ„¢ & Masteringâ„¢ does not come packaged with this content.
